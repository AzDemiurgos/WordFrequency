I have an apple\r I was hoping to eat in silence.<br>\r  Of course.<br> Professor Vinick, I, um\r  I I sketched out a design.<br>\r  It\'d be such an honor\r if you took a look at it.<br>\r  Oh.<br> Well, it is believed\r  that it took the pharaohs\r over 100 years\r  to build the Sphinx.<br>\r  So you think that I\r should spend more time on it.<br>\r  Oh, dear God, no.<br> This is terrible.<br>\r  Then why\'d you mention the Sphinx?\r  I find my mind is often with the Sphinx.<br>\r  Anyway, you\'ll never be an architect.<br>\r  You\'ll never be an architect.<br>\r  You\'ll never be an architect.<br>\r You\'ll never be an architect!\r  Well, guess what.<br>\r I sent Professor Vinick the invitation\r  to the opening of my building\r  so he\'ll see that I did\r become an architect\r  and that I\'ve moved past\r his petty, hurtful words.<br>\r  Wow.<br> Fifteen years later,\r and you\'re still this obsessed.<br>\r  Yeah.<br> If Vinick ever goes missing\r  the cops are gonna come looking\r for him in your basement.<br>\r  Totally.<br> He\'s Ted\'s pit guy.<br>\r  How dare you! And what is that?\r  A "pit guy" is someone you\'ve\r been obsessed with for so long\r  that it\'s driven you crazy enough\r  to throw them\r in the pit in your basement\r  like in The Silence of the Lambs.<br>\r  I\'m not gonna Silence of the Lambs him.<br>\r  At most, I\'d Revenge of the Nerds him.<br>\r  Though I don\'t see a scenario where he\r agrees to play me in a pentathlon.<br>\r  Yeah, I\'m with Ted.<br>\r  There is no one I hate enough\r to throw into a pit.<br>\r  What?\r  When Robin\'s most hated coworker, Patrice\r  started dating Barney,\r she became obsessed.<br>\r  Patrice.<br> Patrice goes into your pit.<br>\r  Guys, I told you.<br>\r  I am done obsessing about Patrice.<br>\r Just drop her.<br>\r  - Drop her in a pit.<br>\r - Enough.<br>\r  We all have people\r that we would throw in our pits\r  and I\'m sure we all have people\r who would like to throw us in their pits.<br>\r  Yeah, if Marshall or I ever go missing\r  I\'ll tell you whose basement\r to look in Daryl LaCourt.<br>\r  Oh, no.<br> It\'s creepy Daryl.<br>\r Let\'s get out of here before he sees us.<br>\r  Hey, Hacky Sack coming through.<br>\r  - Huh.<br> Huh.<br>\r - Hi, Daryl.<br>\r  Hey!

Right, Handlebar Pete?\r  Ah, you got it easy\r with that sweet, sweet stache.<br>\r  Hey, Ted.<br>\r  I see you\'re holding a little version of\r your building and yelling at strangers.<br>\r  So I assume it all worked out.<br>\r  Well, I realized since I work in\r a three-dimensional medium\r  the only way\r to really stick it to Vinick\r  would be with a three-dimensional model.<br>\r  Whatever you do, don\'t\r march in there thinking\r  "I\'m gonna do the worm.<br> That\'ll show \'em.<br>"\r  Seriously, guys, I I can\'t stress enough\r how bad my prom was.<br>\r  Speaking of the past\r  Wow.<br> We feel like idiots.<br>\r We\'re sorry.<br>\r  You know, honestly, it\'s fine.<br>\r  Look how great I\'m doing.<br>\r Look at what I\'ve built.<br>\r  I don\'t need the validations of people\r from college to feel good about myself.<br>\r  My life is amazing!\r  I own a time-share\r in St.<br> Barts with P-Funk.<br>\r  - Th-The whole band?\r - Yeah.<br>\r  - Do you guys jam?\r - That\'s all we do.<br>\r  - No.<br> Uh\r - Uh\r  So you completely rejected the guy\r  who\'s been obsessing about you\r for 16 years, and he was okay with it?\r  Whoa.<br> Is creepy Daryl\r more emotionally adjusted than I am?\r  Kids, sometimes in life\r  you\'ll make a pit\r for someone in your mind.<br>\r  But ultimately, the only person\r in that pit is yourself.<br>\r  I\'m sorry.<br>\r  It\'s just seeing you with Barney\r  has brought out some old feelings\r  and I I really don\'t like feelings.<br>\r  But that\'s not your fault or\r Barney\'s fault.<br>\r  It\'s just really hard seeing you with him.<br>\r  Which means there\'s only one person\r  who can let you out of the pit.<br>\r  No.<br> She stayed.<br>\r  Let\'s get out of here, guys.<br>\r  Oh.<br> Mr.<br> Mosby\r  you built a model of your building.<br>\r  - No.<br>\r - Why?\r  To prove some sort of point?\r This is just sad.<br>\r  No, no.<br> I was just throwing it out.<br>\r  Sure you were.<br>\r  No.<br> No, I-I-I-I had\r a transcendent moment\r  when I found emotional clarity!\r  And I realize shouting now\r makes it seem like it\'s not true\r  but I did!\r  Hey, we\'re gonna grab some snacks.<br>\r You guys want anything?\r  Spicy beef jerky.<br> Got you loud and clear.<br>\r  - Oh, my God.<br> Barney.<br>\r - You un-jinxed me!\r  I\'m free.<br> If the bison on the nickel\r could hear you talk about them\r  they would diminish their population\r even further on purpose.<br>\r  If Lily wants a big wiener in her mouth,\r she\'s got my number.<br>\r  I\'m sorry you took the rap for all\r the farting on the car ride up here.<br>\r  That was me.<br>\r  The ring.<br> What\'s the ring?\r  Right.<br> The ring.<br>\r I\'m gonna ask Patrice to marry me.<br>\r  - Are you serious?\r - Jinx! Good.<br>\r  I need to say some things\r without you interrupting.<br>\r  Yes, I am serious.<br>\r  I know that if you could talk,\r you\'d say that I\'m crazy\r  or that I\'m over correcting or that I\'m\r moving too fast, but you would be wrong.<br>\r  Look, I have banged my way through\r every bimbo in the tri-state area\r  and it left me feeling\r nothing but but broken.<br>\r  But now, with Patrice\r  for the first time in my life,\r I feel settled and happy.<br>\r  I wanna feel this way forever.<br>\r  So tomorrow night on the roof\r of the World Wide News Building\r  that\'s Patrice\'s favorite spot\r I\'m gonna ask her to marry me.<br>\r  - Ah\r - Bo-do-dat.<br> You\'re jinxed.<br>\r  I\'ll un-jinx you\r if you\'ll follow these two rules.<br>\r  One, you can\'t try to talk me out of it\r  and two, you can\'t tell anybody.<br>\r  Agreed?\r  It\'s a jinx swear.<br> So if you break it\r  I get to hit you in the nuts three times\r with a wiffle ball bat.<br>\r  Thank you, Ted.<br>\r  Hey.<br>\r  Hi, guys.<br>\r  Oh, but you\'re jinxed.<br>\r  I tricked Ted into saying my name.<br>\r  Aw, come on, Ted!\r  Jinx!

I I\'m on vacation.<br>\r  I may have cracked open\r the minibar to celebrate.<br>\r  Who invited the narc?\r  Hey, listen.<br>\r I know that you miss Marvin\r  but it\'s not like we could\'ve brought him\r to a black-tie event anyway.<br>\r  I don\'t think that they\r make tuxedo onesies.<br>\r  I mean, at least not ones\r that are in style.<br>\r  I mean, a bow tie?\r Is, uh Is it 1998 already?\r  Yeah.<br> Those parents are\r so lame and and clingy.<br>\r  Yeah, it\'s like,\r "Cut the cord already, right, guys?"\r  Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> That baby\'s not even cute.<br>\r  Super ugly baby.<br>\r It\'s almost physically repulsive.<br>\r  Aw!\r  Great.<br> I just started lactating.<br>\r  Me too.<br>\r  So, what do you wanna do?\r  Robin, I do not want to meddle\r  but this is like\r the classic love song says\r  Ranjit.<br>\r  Ranjit, let\'s just communicate\r via text from now on, okay?\r  I appreciate what you\'re doing\r  but I\'m not chasing after Barney anymore.<br>\r  I I just got done\r being crazy about all that.<br>\r  I mean, why would I wanna\r throw myself back in that pit?\r  - Because you\'re in love with him.<br>\r - No, I\'m not.<br>\r  I\'m happy for him.<br>\r  So it doesn\'t bother you\r  that Barney Stinson\'s gonna\r propose to another woman\r  on top of the World Wide News Building?\r  Why the top\r of the World Wide News Building?\r  I guess it\'s Patrice\'s\r favorite spot in the city.<br>\r  Damn it, Patrice!\r That\'s my favorite spot in the city!\r  Whoa.<br>\r  Ranjit says, "Whoa.<br>"\r  Okay.<br>\r  Maybe that one detail\r stings a little bit.<br>\r  - But that doesn\'t mean I\'m in\r love with Barney.<br> -\r  "Sounds like she\'s in love with Barney.<br>"\r  - Okay, is this divider even\r slightly soundproof? -\r  "Yes.<br>" With a little winky face.<br>\r  Look, I I hope it goes well for Barney.<br>\r I really do.<br>\r  But tonight there\'s no place\r I would rather be\r  than at your building,\r celebrating with you.<br>\r  Are you sure?\r  Ranjit,\r to Teddy Westside\'s kickass building.<br>\r  I cannot hear you.<br>\r  We will be there in five minutes.<br>\r  This kid does not mean\r that you\'re special.<br>\r  It just means that you\'re horny\r and you\'re easy.<br>\r  Now, come on.<br> Let me smell his head.<br>\r  Oh, Lily, Lily.<br> No, no, no, no.<br>\r  Come on.<br>\r  Seriously, Ted, what is up with the floor?\r  - Lily?\r - What?\r  Is it harder than we thought\r to be away from Marvin? Yes.<br>\r  But are we gonna have fun, or are we gonna\r wallow in the corner like idiots?\r  Hey, do you realize that something\r you thought up in your head\r  now exists as a part\r of the Manhattan skyline?\r  That\'s huge.<br>\r  It\'s just a building.<br>\r  I mean, I\'m incredibly young for such an\r achievement, but it\'s just a building.<br>\r  I mean, Architecture Vision Weekly may\r have dubbed it "more than just a building"\r  but it\'s just a building,\r so let\'s not get carried awa\r  Okay, you\'re right.<br> It\'s huge.<br>\r  It is huge.<br> You\'re the star of the party,\r and who knows?\r  Maybe the future Mrs.<br> Ted Mosby\r is gonna be there.<br>\r  Yeah.<br> Maybe she will.<br>\r  Oh.<br> Wait.<br> This isn\'t your\r  This is the World Wide News Building.<br>\r  Go get him.<br>\r  I told you.<br> I am done chasing Barney.<br>\r  Now can we please go to your party?\r  Robin, do you wanna spend tonight making\r small talk with a bunch of bankers\r  in a daring, yet refined\r contemporary masterpiece\r  King Kong should feel lucky to climb\r  or do you wanna follow your heart?\r  Why do you keep insisting\r that I have feelings for Barney?\r  Because you do.<br>\r  See? Even Ranjit agrees.<br>\r  Oh, he\'s gotta pee.<br>\r  The point is you\'re not over Barney.<br>\r  That\'s why you freaked out\r about him proposing\r  on the roof of\r the World Wide News building.<br>\r  I did not freak out.<br>\r  It\'s just a teeny, tiny bit annoying\r  that I am the one who showed her that roof\r in the first place!\r  Damn it, Patrice!\r  Whoa.<br>\r  "Never mind.<br> I found a soda bottle.<br>"\r Okay, that\'s disturbing.<br>\r  What do you want me to do, Ted?\r  Run up to that roof,\r knock the ring out of Barney\'s hand\r  and say, "Sorry to interrupt,\r but you should be with me"?\r  Is that what you want?\r  No.<br>\r  I don\'t.<br>\r  I can\'t keep making an ass of myself.<br>\r  Well, a word in defense\r of making an ass of yourself\r  it\'s underrated.<br>\r  Eight years ago\r  I made an ass of myself\r chasing after you\r  and I\'ve made an ass of myself chasing\r after you a bunch of times since then.<br>\r  But I have no regrets.<br>\r  Because it led me to something\r I wouldn\'t trade for the world.<br>\r  It led to you being my friend.<br>\r  So as your friend\r  and a leading expert in the field\r of making an ass of yourself\r  I say to you\r  from the heart\r  get the hell out of this car.<br>\r  But, Ted\r  your big night.<br>\r  It\'s just a building.<br>\r  The Robin.<br>\r  Step one.<br> Admit to yourself that you still\r have feelings for this girl.<br>\r  I am hopelessly,\r irretrievably in love with her.<br>\r  More than she knows.<br>\r  Step two.<br> Choose\r the completely wrong moment\r  to make a drunken move\r after hanging out at a strip club\r  and get shot down on purpose.<br>\r  Step three.<br>\r Agree that you two don\'t work\r  locking the door on any future\r you could have together.<br>\r  I\'m done trying to get you.<br>\r I can\'t do it anymore.<br>\r  - Which will drive Robin nuts.<br>\r - Huh.<br>\r  Step four.<br> Robin goes nuts.<br>\r  Step five.<br>\r  Find the person who annoys Robin\r most in the world\r  Nobody asked for your help, Patrice!\r  And ask for her help.<br>\r  Oh, hi, Barney.<br> What are you doing here?\r  Actually, I\'m looking for you.<br>\r  This may sound kind of weird,\r but I have a proposition\r  Explain everything to Patrice\r and hope she agrees to help.<br>\r  Yay! I love Robin.<br> Of course I\'ll help.<br>\r  Good.<br> Good.<br>\r  Step six.<br> Check with your doctor\r about possible broken ribs.<br>\r  Step seven.<br> Pretend to be dating Patrice.<br>\r  Nobody asked you here, Patrice!\r  - Actually, I did.<br>\r - Step eight.<br>\r  Wait until Robin inevitably breaks into\r your place to find the playbook\r  and show it to Patrice\r  which you\'ll monitor via the hidden\r cameras you have in your apartment.<br>\r  Patrice, the robin\'s in the nest.<br>\r  That means Robin broke into my apartment.<br>\r  Were you even listening\r when I explained the codes?\r  Step nine.<br> After Patrice finds the playbook,\r have your first big fight.<br>\r  This is going so well.<br> Thank you so much.<br>\r  I know.<br> But what the heck\r are Lily and Ted doing here?\r  I don\'t know.<br>\r My friends have no boundaries.<br>\r  How can I ever thank you?\r  Oh.<br> Will you watch my cat next weekend?\r  No.<br> Come on.<br>\r We should probably go back inside.<br>\r  Step 10.<br> Prove your loyalty to Patrice\r by burning the playbook\r  and actually burn it.<br>\r  You don\'t need it anymore.<br>\r  Step 11.<br> Because your friends\r have no boundaries\r  they\'ll inevitably have\r an intervention for Robin\r  which you\'ll monitor via the hidden cameras\r you have in Marshall and Lily\'s apartment.<br>\r  Step 12.<br> Tell only Ted about\r your plan to propose to Patrice.<br>\r  You can\'t tell anybody.<br> Agreed?\r  Step 13.<br> Wait and see if Ted tells Robin.<br>\r  And if he does\r  Barney\'s getting engaged.<br>\r  It means your best bro in the world\r has let go of Robin\r  and has given you his blessing.<br>\r  Step 14.<br> Robin arrives at\r her favorite spot in the city\r  and finds the secret final page\r of the playbook\r  the last play you\'ll ever run.<br>\r  Step 15.<br>\r  Robin realizes she\'s standing\r underneath mistletoe.<br>\r  Seriously, Barney?\r  Even you\r  Even someone\r as certifiably insane as you\r  must realize that this is too far.<br>\r  You lied to me, manipulated me for weeks.<br>\r  Do Do you really think\r I could ever kiss you after that?\r  Do you really think\r I could ever trust you after that?\r  This This is proof of why we don\'t work,\r why we\'ll never work.<br>\r  So thank you.<br> You\'ve set me free.<br>\r  Because how could I be with a man\r  who thinks that this trick,\r this enormous lie\r  could ever make me wanna date him again?\r  Turn it over.<br>\r  Robin Scherbatsky.<br>\r  Will you marry me?\r  Yes.<br>\r  And so let\'s all raise\r a glass to Ted Mosby.<br>\r  None of this would\'ve been\r possible without him.<br>\r  - To Ted.<br>\r - To Ted!\r      <br>\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <div style="padding: 4px;
